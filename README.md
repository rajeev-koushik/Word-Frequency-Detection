# Word-Frequency-Detection

I have written this simple program to read an Excel file column, perform text cleaning, count the frequency of the words present and return a CSV file with the words and their count. It is sorted in descending order based on the frequency. 

I have included both a .py file and a .ipynb file.

Technologies used:
1. pandas
2. nltk
